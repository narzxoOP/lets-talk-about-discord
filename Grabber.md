How I recovered thousands of discord accounts, xbox & nitro codes for free without doing anything thanks to github.
You thought you were safe?, what if I tell you that I recovered more than a thousand discord accounts without anyone ever realizing it? You just have to say "I have an exploit" to make people believe you when in reality it's all something else. You will tell me "but I've never seen grabber tokens in your scripts", I would answer you "you're never safe on the internet", let me show you :)

Take one of my repos, simple: https://github.com/Its-Vichy/Disboard-Scraper, at first sight no token grabber? this script is 100% safe!



Haha very safe right? here is the package on pypi: https://pypi.org/project/colorfull/

I just actually made a very simple but effective token grabber, I could very simply have injected a custom payload such as piratestealer in order to recover and change the passwords automatically, but that was not my goal ^^ . the token grabber uses a perfectly multithreaded token checker to grab all in a second.



Then the tokens were sent to an API which had time to check all of them, the checker in the grabber is just there to avoid the flooding of the API. She looked:

Means of payment
The codes in the inventory
The profile in detail
If the token was already retrieved
Then comes the moment a little more "fun", less ethical but it was for a good cause, I could have done real damage if I wanted to do harm. The api code was done in 30min and therefore is totally disgusting but functional: https://github.com/Its-Vichy/lets-talk-about-discord/blob/main/api.py

Notament she bought nitro by herself, I could have made a system to redeem directly on my account but I wanted to give all the nitro to friends who did not have the means to have some, personally I have my 5dc with a few months of nitro from my sniper ;)

Initially the name was "colorama" (yes like the real module) and had the "o" in Cyrilic so it was invisible, but pypi didn't really like it:(

The database:

What happens with people who have been logged in
Nothing special other than being used as a sniper & nitro buyer.
If the person was harmful, I nukai his account ex: roro the h4x0r the sure tiktok & (scammer, fake, skid)
1.3k download of my malware, imagine if i dont talk about that and put it on all of my project etc... please be careful
